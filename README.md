# DS_Project_-Sebastian-Capuyan-

My CS 131 project is about the concept of matrix addition and multiplication. In it, I go over the basic definition of a matrix and how to multiply and add matrices. 
In addition, I also review when it is appropriate to add and multiply matrices and where in the real world these concepts are applied.
