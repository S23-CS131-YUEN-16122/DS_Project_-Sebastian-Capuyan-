My CS 131 project is about the concept of matrix addition and multiplication. In it, I go over the basic definition of a matrix and how to multiply and add matrices. In addition, I also review when it is appropriate to add and multiply matrices and how to easily do it without being confused by the long detention. Finally, I go over how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios in people's daily lives.
